## WIP Limits
Here are the work in progress (WIP) limits for this board.  WIP limits are used to control the number of issues active in each process step at any one time.  The WIP count for a step includes issues being worked on, and issues that are done and waiting to be pulled into the next step.

The table shows the total issues allowed in a column, with the number of marker issues in parentheses.  Thus a WIP limit of 7(1) allows 6 issues active in the column.

| Column | WIP Limit | 
| --- | --- |
| New Issues | none |
| Blocked | none |
| Backlog | none | 
| Decomp | 3 |
| Design | 2 |
